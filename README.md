# Universal AI

Universal AI is going to push the boundary of artificial general intelligence. Thanks Professor David Aldous from UC Berkeley for the books suggestion:  https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/205B/index.html

## Books

### Books

**R. Durrett** [Probability: Theory and Examples \(4th edition\)](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Cambridge-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521765390). 

**P. Billingsley** Probability and Measure \(3rd Edition\). Chapters 1-30 contain a more careful and detailed treatment of some of the topics of this semester, in particular the measure-theory background. Recommended for students who have not done measure theory.

**R. Leadbetter et al** [A Basic Course in Measure and Probability: Theory for Applications ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107652529/)is a new book giving a careful treatment of the measure-theory background.

There are many other books at roughly the same \`\`first year graduate" level. Here are my personal comments on some.

**D. Khoshnevisan** [Probability ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107652529/)is a well-written concise account of the key topics in 205AB.

**R. Bhattacharya and E. C. Waymire** [A Basic Course in Probability Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Course-Probability-Theory-Universitext/dp/3319479725) is another well-written account, mostly on the 205A topics.

**K.L. Chung**[ A Course in Probability Theory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107652529/) covers many of the topics of 205A: more leisurely than Durrett and more focused than Billingsley.

**D. Williams** [Probability with Martingales ](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Martingales-Cambridge-Mathematical-Textbooks/dp/0521406056/)has a uniquely enthusiastic style; concise treatment emphasizes usefulness of martingales.

**Y.S. Chow and H. Teicher**[ Probability Theory: Independence, Interchangeability, Martingales ](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-Independence-Interchangeability-Martingales/dp/0387406077/). Uninspired exposition, but has useful variations on technical topics such as inequalities for sums and for martingales.

**R.M. Dudley**[ Real Analysis and Probability](http://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Probability-Cambridge-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0521007542). Best account of the functional analysis and metric space background relevant for research in theoretical probability.

**B. Fristedt and L. Gray**[ A Modern Approach to Probability Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Approach-Probability-Theory-Applications/dp/0817638075/). 700 pages allow coverage of broad range of topics in probability and stochastic processes.

**L. Breiman**[ Probability](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Classics-Applied-Mathematics-Breiman/dp/0898712963/). Classical; concise and broad coverage.

**O. Kallenberg** [Foundations of Modern Probability](http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Modern-Probability-Its-Applications/dp/0387953132). Quoting an amazon.com reviewer: \`\`.... a compendium of all the relevant results of probability ..... similar in breadth and depth to Loeve's classical text of the mid 70's. It is not suited as a textbook, as it lacks the many examples that are needed to absorb the theory at a first pass. It works best as a reference book or a "second pass" textbook."

**John B. Walsh** [Knowing the Odds: An Introduction to Probability](http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Odds-Introduction-Probability-Mathematics/dp/0821885324). New in 2012. Looks very nice -- concise treatment with quite challenging exercises developing part of theory.

**George Roussas** [An Introduction to Measure-Theoretic Probability](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Measure-Theoretic-Probability-Second/dp/0128000422/ref=asap_B00JALV1Z8_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412368880&sr=1-1). Recent treatment of classical content.

**Santosh Venkatesh** [The Theory of Probability: Explorations and Applications](http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Probability-Explorations-Applications/dp/1107024471). Unique new book, intertwining a broad range of undergraduate and graduate-level topics for an applied audience.

**I. Florescu** [Probability and Stochastic Processes](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Stochastic-Processes-Ionut-Florescu/dp/0470624558/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427746625&sr=1-2&keywords=florescu). Very clearly written, and with 550 pages gives a broad coverage of topics including intro to SDEs.

Jim Pitman has his [very useful lecture notes](http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/205/WorkInProgress/DurrettTOC.html) linked to the Durrett text; these notes cover more ground than my course will! Also some [lecture notes by Amir Dembo ](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~amir/stat-310b/lnotes.pdf)for the Stanford courses equivalent to our 205AB.
