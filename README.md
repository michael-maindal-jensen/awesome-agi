# Universal AI

Universal AI is going to push the boundary of artificial general intelligence.

$$
\mathbf{uai} = \underset{\theta}{\arg\max}\ \mathcal{AGI}(\theta)
$$

## Concepts

* [Kolmogorov complexity](./)

## Frameworks

## Important Papers

* [Universal Transformers ](universal-transformers.md)
