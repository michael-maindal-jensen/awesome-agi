We introduce the Forget-me-not Process, an efficient, non-parametric metaalgorithm
for online probabilistic sequence prediction for piecewise stationary,
repeating sources. Our method works by taking a Bayesian approach to partitioning
a stream of data into postulated task-specific segments, while simultaneously
building a model for each task. We provide regret guarantees with respect to piecewise
stationary data sources under the logarithmic loss, and validate the method
empirically across a range of sequence prediction and task identification problems.
