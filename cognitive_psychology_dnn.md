# Cognitive Psychology for Deep Neural Networks: A Shape Bias Case Study
In this work, we have demonstrated how techniques from
cognitive psychology can be leveraged to help us better understand
DNNs. As a case study, we measured the shape
bias in two powerful yet poorly understood DNNs - Inception
and MNs. Our analysis revealed previously unknown
properties of these models. More generally, our work leads
the way for future exploration of DNNs using the rich body
of techniques developed in cognitive psychology
